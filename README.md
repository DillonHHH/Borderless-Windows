# Borderless Windows

# Windows Only For Now

A little project I made in a day as a replacement for Borderless Gaming since it often crashed, froze, and simply didn't work.

May continue work on this app in the future, for now it should work to maximize the selected app to your primary monitor, and the "Make Borderless" button toggles the selected window between borderless and not borderless.
